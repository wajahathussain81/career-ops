// Shared optional-section stripping for the CV builders (build-cv-html.mjs,
// build-cv-latex.mjs).
//
// Projects, education, certifications, and awards are the genuinely optional
// CV sections: a candidate's projects are often already covered under Work
// Experience, not every candidate has a degree, not every application carries a
// certification worth listing, and most candidates have no award to name. The
// templates wrap all four unconditionally, so a payload with no entries renders
// a bare section header with nothing under it. The builders'
// buildProjects()/buildEducation()/buildCertifications()/buildAwards()
// correctly return '' — nothing removes the surrounding wrapper, which is what
// this module does.
//
// Certifications has no marker in the LaTeX template (cv-template.tex has no
// Certifications section at all), so PATTERNS.tex has no `certifications` key
// — stripEmptySections skips a section silently when the active format has no
// pattern for it, rather than trying to match against `undefined`. Awards, by
// contrast, is defined for both formats.
//
// The section body is delimited by markers rather than parsed, so the boundary
// pattern carries the whole correctness burden and is easy to get subtly wrong:
//
//   - Stopping at any capitalized comment would also stop at an ordinary
//     comment inside a section body, truncating the strip and leaving markup
//     behind. Markers are therefore matched as all-caps only.
//   - Omitting the end-of-input branch would silently keep a section that
//     happens to be last in the template.
//   - Naming the expected successor ("projects is followed by education")
//     couples the two strips to each other and to template ordering: once an
//     empty education block is removed, a named lookahead for it stops matching
//     and the projects header survives.
//
// Each of those failure modes reintroduces the bare header this module exists
// to remove, and does it silently, so they are covered in
// tests/cv-optional-sections.test.mjs.
